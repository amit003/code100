"""below is the logic for swapping and storing in a new matrix as transpose of the original matrix
in the inner list, the value will range between 0 to the row val, and in the outer list, it will
range from 0 to the max col val
so, the assignment take place as [0][0],[1][0],[2][0]..[0][1],[1][1],[2][1] and so on
